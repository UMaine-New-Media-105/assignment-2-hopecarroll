For challenge 1 of assignment 2 I used my sketch from assignment 1, gridded initials with squares, but this time used a function to create the sketch.
The function had a varible called "topY" which allowed me to created the sketch using only 5 rect commands instead of 25. The sketch creates my initial
by changing the colors of 7 squares to create an "H."

For challenge 2 of assignment 2 I created a heart shape using the "beginShape" and "endShape" command along with 4 vertex commands. 
I used the fill command to make my heart pink and I used red for my background color.

For challenge 3 of assignment 2 I used the same shape from challenge 2 but put the shape inside a function called "drawHeartShape." 
From there, I called the function in order to change the parameters of the heart shape to fill the whole canvas.

For challenge 4 of assignment 2 I created a fictional flag combining the colors and designs of the Honduras and Cameroon flags which match the initials of 
my name, (H)ope (C)arroll. Using p5.js I did this by three seperate custom functions. The first being blueHonduras which created the top and bottom blue rectangles which can be found in the real Honduras flag. The second function was HondurasStars which created seven blue stars and one yellow star. The orginal Honduras flag as five stars but to add a creative element I added to extra stars to make a smiley face. The middle star is yellow instead of blue because the in the Cameroon flag there is one middle yellow star. The final custom function was CameroonColors which created the green, red and yellow rectangles which can be found in the read Cameroon flag.
