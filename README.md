For challenge 1 of assignment 2 I used my sketch from assignment 1, gridded initials with squares, but this time used a function to create the sketch.
The function had a varible called "topY" which allowed me to created the sketch using only 5 rect commands instead of 25. The sketch creates my initial
by changing the colors of 7 squares to create an "H."

For challenge 2 of assignment 2 I created a heart shape using the "beginShape" and "endShape" command along with 4 vertex commands. 
I used the fill command to make my heart pink and I used red for my background color.

For challenge 3 of assignment 2 I used the same shape from challenge 2 but put the shape inside a function called "drawHeartShape." 
From there, I called the function in order to change the parameters of the heart shape to fill the whole canvas.
